# WireGuard VPN Setup from Cuba

Hi! I'm Yunior, and I’m working on setting up a personal WireGuard VPN to improve access to restricted services from Cuba.

## Why?

Due to heavy internet restrictions in Cuba, many essential tools and platforms are blocked or limited. My goal is to set up a lightweight, self-hosted VPN server using WireGuard to securely tunnel traffic and bypass those restrictions.

## My Use Case

- Deploy a minimal Debian 12 VPS
- Set up a WireGuard VPN server
- Connect from my iOS device
- Document the entire process to help others in similar situations

## Contact

You can also find me participating in technical forums like Móviles DualSIM and in the LowEndSpirit community (LES).

Thanks for reading!
